Dear Mr. Evel,

We are writing to inform you of an exciting new initiative by the Umbrella Corporation.

In addition, we are pleased to offer a special membership program exclusively for Raccoon City residents. This program will provide access to advanced medical treatments and technologies at our state-of-the-art facilities, as well as exclusive invitations to private events and previews of upcoming projects.

To kick off this initiative, we are hosting a grand opening event at the Umbrella Corporation Community Center on July 1, 2024, at 10:00 AM. The event will feature guest speakers, demonstrations, and a chance to meet with our team to discuss any concerns or suggestions you may have. Light refreshments will be provided.

We believe that by working together, we can create a safer, healthier, and more vibrant community. Your involvement is crucial, and we hope you will join us in this endeavor.

*Note: The health and safety of our residents are our top priorities. All events will be conducted following the latest health guidelines and protocols to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for all participants.*
